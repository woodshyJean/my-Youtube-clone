Hosted Page : https://my-youtube-clone-zeta.vercel.app/

A Youtube clone made with React.

The end goal is to get a somewhat close copy to the real thing.

Sometime in the future i will include individual pages per video with the use of Express?

Might transfer the Mock data to an backend with the use of mongodb?

First save: 6/25/2022 created basic UI | Created Mock data | Videos play on mouseEnter

Second save: 6/26/2022 added an "ok" search feature | created youtube search result card | attempting to figure out how to route | 
to be able to search for now you must add /search to the end of the url
