Hosted Page : https://my-youtube-clone-psi.vercel.app/

A Youtube clone made with React.

The end goal is to get a somewhat close copy to the real thing.

Sometime in the future i will include individual pages per video with the use of Express?

Might transfer the Mock data to an backend with the use of mongodb?

First save: 6/25/2022 created basic UI | Created Mock data | Videos play on mouseEnter
